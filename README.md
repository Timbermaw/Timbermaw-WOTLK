How to use the bugtracker
-------------------------
On the Bugtracker all reports must be written in English so that everyone, no matter which language they use everyday, could search and check if the problem already has been reported by another player.

 - Use the search engine to find out if a similar problem has been already reported. If so, check if it's already been fixed and waits for update.
 - Make sure, that what you report is actually a bug.
 - Enclose links to things related to the bug using http://wowhead.com or http://wotlk.openwow.com
 - Write your tickets according to the format:<br>
  * `[Quest][Zone]` Collecting Kelp<br>
  * `[NPC]` Thoralius the Wise<br>
  * `[Spell][Class]` Fireball<br>
  * `[Talent][Class]` Searing Light<br>
  * `[Glyph][Class]` Glyph of Nourish<br>
  * `[Npc][Drop]` Thoralius the Wise<br>
  * `[Web]` Armory doesnt work
